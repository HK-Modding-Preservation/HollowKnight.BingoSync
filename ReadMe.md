# BingoSync

A Hollow Knight mod that automatically marks squares on bingosync.com

Just paste the link of the BingoSync room into the game and join the room. When you open a new save the board will show up and squares will be automatically marked when you complete them in-game

For now only works for the "Normal" variant of the game, but implementing other variants should not be that hard
